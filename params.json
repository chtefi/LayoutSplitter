It will be split according to where your mouse is (top/bottom/right/left).\r\n- You can drop an image from your file explorer to a cell\r\n- You can right-click to remove the current image of a cell or to cancel the split of a cell (if there was no image).\r\n\r\n# Example \r\n\r\nIn 4 clicks, you can create the layout :\r\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chtefi/LayoutSplitter/master/help/custom_images_before.PNG)\r\n\r\nThen, by dropping from the file explorer to each cell :\r\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chtefi/LayoutSplitter/master/help/custom_images.png)\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n- Be able to export flat HTML structure (without the containers)\r\n- Be able to save the state to be able to reload it\r\n- Display a treeview of this structure\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
